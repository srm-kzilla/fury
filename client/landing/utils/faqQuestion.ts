      question: "How many domains can I apply to at once?",
      answer:
        "You can apply to 2 domains in total, but keep in mind that you can only keep one domain in draft. So finish filling the answers for one domain, submit it, and then move on to the next. (You can also delete a draft)",
    },
    {
      question: "The portal is giving me an error.",
      answer:
        "No need to panic, the error might be due to the slow internet or some internal issues. We'll hash everything out, you have 6 more days to fill the form.",
    },
    {
      question: "Do I need to have a resume?",
      answer:
        "No, you need not have a resume, it's fine to apply without it, but you should make one since you're going to be applying for internships soon.",
    },
    {
      question: "I do not have much experience, can I still apply?",
      answer:
        "Yes, for sure. A lot of current SRMKZILLA members did not have any experience in their domain, go ahead and give your best, we love enthusiasm a lot.",
    },
    {
      question: "I made some mistakes in answers and other data, what to do?",
      answer:
        "You can email us at technical@srmkzilla.net, and we'll sort it out!",
    },
    {
      question: "I've filled my form, when can I hear back?",
      answer:
        "We will start reviewing applications on a rolling basis. You can check the dashboard once every day; we'll update it over there. We will also send an email so that you do not miss the interviews ðŸ¥°.",
    },
    {
      question: "What is the interview experience process?",
      answer:
        "All the applications we like will get a chance to sit for the interviews. Every domain has separate interviews (one round), where we ask domain-specific questions. Once all interviews are wrapped, we will publish the results on our Instagram handle!",
    },
