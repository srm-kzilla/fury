            </h2>
            <p>
              Like most website operators, SRMKZILLA collects
              non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web
              browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser
              type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time
              of each visitor request. SRMKZILLA&apos;s purpose in collecting
              non-personally identifying information is to better understand how
              SRMKZILLA&apos;s visitors use its website. From time to time,
              SRMKZILLA may release non-personally-identifying information in
              the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage
              of its website.
            </p>
            <p>
              SRMKZILLA also collects potentially personally-identifying
              information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. SRMKZILLA does
              not use such information to identify its visitors, however, and
              does not disclose such information, other than under the same
              circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying
              information, as described below. We may also collect and use IP
              addresses to block users who violated our Terms of Service.

              Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information
            </h2>
            <p>
              Certain visitors to SRMKZILLA&apos;s websites choose to interact
              with SRMKZILLA in ways that require SRMKZILLA to gather
              personally-identifying information. The amount and type of
              information that SRMKZILLA gathers depends on the nature of the
              interaction. SRMKZILLA collects such information only insofar as
              is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the
              visitor&apos;s interaction with SRMKZILLA. SRMKZILLA does not
              disclose personally-identifying information other than as
              described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply
              personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may
              prevent them from engaging in certain Service-related activities.
            </p>
            <p>
              Additionally, some interactions, such as posting a comment, may
              ask for optional personal information. For instance, when posting
              a comment, may provide a website that will be displayed along with
              a user&apos;s name when the comment is displayed. Supplying such
              personal information is completely optional and is only displayed
              for the benefit and the convenience of the user.

              Aggregated Statistics
            </h2>
            <p>
              SRMKZILLA may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to
              the Service. For instance, SRMKZILLA may monitor the most popular
              parts of the https://recruitments.srmkzilla.net. SRMKZILLA may
              display this information publicly or provide it to others.
              However, SRMKZILLA does not disclose personally-identifying
              information other than as described below.

              Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information

            <p>
              SRMKZILLA discloses potentially personally-identifying and
              personally-identifying information only to those of its employees,
              contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know
              that information in order to process it on SRMKZILLA&apos;s behalf
              or to provide services available at SRMKZILLA&apos;s websites, and
              (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those
              employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located
              outside of your home country; by using the Service, you consent to
              the transfer of such information to them. SRMKZILLA will not rent
              or sell potentially personally-identifying and
              personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its
              employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described
              above, SRMKZILLA discloses potentially personally-identifying and
              personally-identifying information only when required to do so by
              law, or when SRMKZILLA believes in good faith that disclosure is
              reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of
              SRMKZILLA, third parties or the public at large. If you are a
              registered user of the Service and have supplied your email
              address, SRMKZILLA may occasionally send you an email to tell you
              about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to
              date with what&apos;s going on with SRMKZILLA and our products. We
              primarily use our website and blog to communicate this type of
              information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum.
              If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via
              one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish
              it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to
              help us support other users. SRMKZILLA takes all measures
              reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access,
              use, alteration or destruction of potentially
              personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.
