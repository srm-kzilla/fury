## Structure

Fury is a monorepo meaning multiple projects, components, and packages are stored in a single repository. In a monorepo, all related code is managed together, rather than splitting it into separate repositories for each project.We have structured our project in such a way that it has **three** projects in one repository! So let us explain our structure to you.

`Client` is composed of three folders:

`landing`- Landing Page of Recruitments'23- where you find out about recruitments.<br>
`dashboard`- User Dashboard - where you fill applications to be recruited.<br>
`admin`-Admin Dashboard - where we read your application and decide if you are a good fit for us.<br>

### Landing

The Landing Page is a NextJS application written in TypeScript using Tailwindcss for styling.

### Dashboard

The User Dashboard is a Remix application written in TypeScript with Sass Styles.

### Admin

The Landing Page is a NextJS application written in TypeScript using Tailwindcss for styling.

Happy Coding :)
